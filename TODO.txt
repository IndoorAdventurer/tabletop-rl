UP NEXT:
# Cards/CardCollection stuff:
* Implement insert function for Stack
* Add functionality to CardHand. During the game it must be able to:
    * Pick a card from the deck
    * Place a card on the discard pile
    * Insert an exploding kitten anywhere in the deck
    * Take a known card from another player
    * Take a random card from another player
    * Give a known card to another player

LONG TERM:
* Extent functionality to also encapsulate who knows what.
    * Make this optional!
