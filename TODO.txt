UP NEXT:
# Cards/CardCollection stuff:
* Add functionality to CardHand. During the game it must be able to:
    * Pick a card from the deck [CHECK/NO UNITTEST YET THO]
    * Place a card on the discard pile [CHECK/NO UNITTEST YET THO]
    * Insert an exploding kitten anywhere in the deck [CHECK/NO UNITTEST YET THO]
    * Take a known card from another player [CHECK/NO UNITTEST YET THO]
    * Take a random card from another player [CHECK/NO UNITTEST YET THO]
    * Give a known card to another player [CHECK/NO UNITTEST YET THO]

LONG TERM:
* Extent functionality to also encapsulate who knows what.
    * Make this optional!
    * Turn Cards into a template for this that only accepts CardHand derivatives
      with CardHand self as default value.
* Beware of the following:
    * With Favor and Two Card Combo, there is a "bug" in the rules that one
      one might play their nope to prevent it, but that the nope gets noped,
      resulting in having to give/take a card while none are there. In this
      case, it is best to just not give/take anything.

LONGER TERM:
* Implement 'Regenwormen'.
* Implement 'Mens erger je niet'.
