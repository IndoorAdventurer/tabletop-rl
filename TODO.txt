UP NEXT:
* Implement game states.
* Implement game actions.

LONG TERM:
* Extent functionality to also encapsulate who knows what.
    * Make this optional!
    * Should only be the case for specific CardHands, so maybe just create
      something of a change listener that is directly linked to the related
      agent.
* Beware of the following:
    * With Favor and Two Card Combo, there is a "bug" in the rules that one
      one might play their nope to prevent it, but that the nope gets noped,
      resulting in having to give/take a card while none are there. In this
      case, it is best to just not give/take anything.
* Refactor card_defs.ih: I can make it shorter when using the std::integer_range
  thingy.

LONGER TERM:
* Implement 'Regenwormen'.
* Implement 'Mens erger je niet'.
